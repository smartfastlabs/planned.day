# Planned.day

## This is a project I have been thinking about for a while. I have always wanted one single source of truth for what I need to get done to have a "productive day"...

### tldr: That's pretty complex.

# Project Goals

    - Integrate with all of my Calendars
    - Track ADLS: meals, water, exercise, hygiene, etc.
    - Integrate with my Field Notebook Wallet.
    - Make sure I never get surprised by a meeting again.
        - daily/weekly/monthyl view making sure I know what I have
        - push notifications leading up to meeting
        - SIREN 2 minutes before meeting starts.
    - Integrate with LLM:
        - "Hey Leo what does my day look like today?"
    - Voice control (from home).
    - Runs Locally
