# Generating VAPID Keys for Web Push

VAPID (Voluntary Application Server Identification) keys are a public/private key pair used to authenticate your push notification server with browser push services. The public key is shared with clients during subscription, while the private key remains on the server and is used to sign outgoing push messages. These keys help ensure that push notifications come from a trusted and verifiable sender.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js installed
- `web-push` available (globally or via `npx`)

## Option 1: Generate VAPID Keys via CLI

If installed globally:

    npm install -g web-push
    web-push generate-vapid-keys

Using `npx` (recommended):

    npx web-push generate-vapid-keys

Expected output:

    =======================================
    Public Key:
    BOgk0QF...

    Private Key:
    tVYlH6...

    =======================================

## Option 2: Generate VAPID Keys Programmatically

Install locally:

    npm install web-push --save-dev

Create a script (for example: `scripts/generateVapid.js`):

    // scripts/generateVapid.js
    const webPush = require('web-push');

    const keys = webPush.generateVAPIDKeys();

    console.log('Public Key:\n', keys.publicKey);
    console.log('\nPrivate Key:\n', keys.privateKey);

Run the script:

    node scripts/generateVapid.js
